### **This is the Image Gallery Example App**

This app was created for the [Sonar](https://www.sonarhealth.co) Coding Challenge

The application was built using a combination of CleanVIP Architecture and MVVM

There's a [dependency](https://github.com/JanGorman/MapleBacon) that was installed using Swift Package Manager

This challenge could be solved using something more simple like just MVVM, but I assumed for this test that this will be the base of something that will be gaining complexity over time, and that's why I went with this combination.

The benefits are that I created a highly scalable and testable code that separates all the responsibilities and help us to keep our classes clean and simple.
